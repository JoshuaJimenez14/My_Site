 <h1>About Me</h1> 
 <h2>
Hello my name is Joshua Jimenez! I like to play video games in my spare time and I also really like to play sports and go to the gym.
I like playing League of Legends and some other games as well like party animals. I've played soccer most of my life and I played volleyball
for a couple years as well. I've been pretty skinny my whole life so the gym has been really helpful to me on my own personal image. 
The main reason why I decided to join this cohort is because I was doing community college and it felt like I was wasting my time.
When brainstorming potential career changes I thought maybe I could try it. I've lived in Texas my whole life but I would like to eventually
go see other places.
